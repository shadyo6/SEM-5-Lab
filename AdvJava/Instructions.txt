Termwork 1:
--> Create Files on desktop or anywhere in side your file explorer
--> copy the path name for input and output files
--> FileInputStream fip = new FileInputStream("input.txt"); 
	replace input.txt with the input file location
--> FileOutputStream fop = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");

--> run the code
--> while entering the path of the destination file in the console, enter the copied output file path
your path should look like this:
C:\\Users\\Desktop\\filename.txt
